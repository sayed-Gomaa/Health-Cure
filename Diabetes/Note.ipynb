    "In the case of a real-world dataset, it is very common that some values in the dataset are missing. We represent these missing values as NaN (Not a Number) values. But to build a good machine learning model our dataset should be complete. Thatâ€™s why we use some imputation techniques to replace the NaN values with some probable values. But before doing that we need to have a good understanding of how the NaN values are distributed in our dataset.\n",
